        My name is Ethan Tsai, I am currently an undergraduate studying at UCR in Prebusiness as a first year. For my work experience, I have worked at UCR as a part-time worker. Outside of jobs, I have volunteered at several community-hosted events such as a school fair where I was helping manage a variety of entertainment for young students. On top of this, I contributed to my local church ever since I was in high school and participated in multiple volunteer jobs. These include providing necessities for the homeless during the pandemic where my mother and I provided over 500 baked goods homemade as well as help distribute them afterward. Another notable volunteer event was the assistance for Red Cross where I helped create countless care packages for soldiers. These experiences helped me develop essential skills such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork skills. I also have a high school diploma where I graduated with honors and on a Silver level, the highest scholar award that could be reached as a result of my GPA and community service. During my time in high school, I enrolled in many different AP classes. These included AP Psychology, AP Government, AP Biology, AP Environmental Science, AP European History, AP Language and Composition, AP Economics, AP Calculus AB, AP Literature and Composition, and AP U.S. History. These classes helped shape my time management abilities as well as learning to handle copious amounts of stress and work in a little amount of time. Including these classes, I took several honors classes as well as advanced my education in Chinese as a second language. This allowed me to be able to communicate with others despite a language barrier and has opened many opportunities in terms of interactions and collaboration. The church that I volunteered for was predominately Chinese, and as such, would mostly speak in Chinese, limiting my interaction with most of the people there. However, taking the class has allowed me to not only talk but work with everyone.

        I have several skills that help with jobs such as video editing various clips and videos through video editing software. I also have experience with Photoshop software through various practices with social media. I am hardworking and can often manage a large team as I did so while working with a club that I created. My club worked with local pet shops and pet shelters to do volunteer work as well as donate. Volunteer work would include working with the animals that ranged from feeding to cleaning and accompanying them to prevent emotional trauma. Having to manage the club required multiple skills such as being able to multi-task on a daily basis as well as dividing up work and responsibilities equally to prevent build-up. Being able to work with others was also a necessity to be successful. I had to work with several different people that included businesses, students, and teachers. This wide array of interactions helped me develop skills that dealt with discovering resources and learning how to reach out to certain people or places. It also taught me how to write in a more professional manner that was concise and respectful.
